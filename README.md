# SimpleTime
The SimpleTime format: native edition!

# Building from Source
Download and install `node`, `npm` and `expo-cli`. Clone or download the git repository and `cd` into that directory. Then run:
```bash
npm install
```
to install all required `node` and `typescript` dependencies.
## Development Server
Run the following to start a development server.
```bash
npm start
```
## APK
Run the following to generate a fresh APK for Android:
```bash
expo build:android -t apk
```

# Messing Around
You can play with the source by editing the three main source files:
* `SimpleTime/Frontend.tsx` -- the frontend (UI) written using `react-native`.
* `SimpleTime/Backend.tsx` -- the backend.
* `App.tsx` -- the main application.

# Pull Requests
Knock yourself out; if I don't like it I won't accept it so don't hesitate to through around ideas. Happy coding!

# Experience
This is my first `react-native` + `expo` application so any advice is really appreciated.
